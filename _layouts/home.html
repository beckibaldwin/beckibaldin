                    <p>I have only recently started training with Becki, and was so impressed with her dedication and commitment to making sure everyone attending has the best experience from her classes. To say she’s passionate is an understatement! She is full of positive energy, extremely knowledgeable, and always smiling & encouraging us. She goes the extra mile in her communication to all her clients on and off the screen.</p>

                    <h4>Gemma</h4>
                    <p>Becki's energy is absolutely brilliant!!! She is one of the few instructors that enables me to fully get lost in a class .  The vibe, the energy is infectious and dont get me started on the playlist these are AMAZING. Her classes can work for all for abilities too, breaking down positions easily but it does not detract against thosse who are more experienced either.</p>

                    <h4>Patricia</h4>
                    <p>Becki is seriously the absolute best instructor! Her yoga classes are my go to favorite — her voice is very calming, her readings make your soul happy and her classes are both powerful and rejuvenating. She has the brightest, happiest spirit and it is truly contagious. You leave her classes feeling uplifted and like you can take on the day (and world)</p>
